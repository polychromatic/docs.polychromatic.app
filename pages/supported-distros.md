## Official Packages

We create packages for the following distros. This requires adding our repository,
or installing a package (`.pkg.tar.zst` or `.deb`) separately from the [release notes].

Updates can be expected shortly after a new release.

* Debian, Ubuntu (and derivatives) via [Launchpad].
* Arch Linux (and derivatives) via the [AUR] [(-git)].
* Fedora, openSUSE and Mageia via [openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/hardware:razer/polychromatic)

See the [Download page] for instructions.

## Universal Package Formats

We highly recommend [using native packages](https://polychromatic.app/download/)
for the best feature experience. We understand there may be
reasons to use other formats, such as operating systems with an immutable (read only) file system.

We only provide a Flatpak providing the Controller experience only.
There are limitations, and you still need to install OpenRazer on the host.
See the [Flatpak download page] for details.

AppImage and Snaps are not available at this time.
